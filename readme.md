# Introduction

This project aims to find out if WiFi channel occupancy within the 2.4GHz spectrum can be found using a simple promiscuous scan of packets on each channel and then summarising the results in a occupancy table. This table will show the amount of packets received in each channel and classify each channel according to set limits.
The channel with the lowest occupancy will be display on the screen.
